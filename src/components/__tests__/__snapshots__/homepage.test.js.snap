          The Design Compass is a classroom tool for helping students and professionals record and reflect on their design process as they work on and complete a design challenge. The Design Compass software provides an interface where students can identify and record the various design steps they used while performing them, and add digital notes and pictures to document their work. In the analysis view, a record of the work done as well as a graph of time spent on each design step can be shared and discussed with instructors or coworkers.

          The user interface has two pages. The Compass page gives the option of a standard engineering design process model as well as a custom model with the means for entering short text-based descriptions by users, and clocks to note time spent on each design step. The Log page provides a spreadsheet-styled chronological list of steps taken, and is the place where users can view, edit and append the logged information. By clicking on another button in the Log, users can view aggregated data in histogram form on steps they have taken during a single design session or an entire design project.
